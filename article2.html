The name of the album was hinted several times this summer by the rapper, but the official announcement was on September 28 on the rapper's Instagram. 

The 16-track album features people like Hip-Hop Superstar Travis Scott and new-found Rap artists like SoFaygo or HVN. Production done by the one and only MIKE DEAN and Don's long time partners like Dez Wright or Metro Boomin.

"My life your life."
<p class="article">
    stated by Don Toliver on his Instagram, he intends to talk about his personal life and let his fans listen to him as not Don Toliver, but as Caleb for the very first time. Tracks like Double Standards, Swangin' on Westheimer or Crossfaded are the perfect examples for this.
    
    Compared to Heaven or Hell we don't get as many hype songs but tracks like Flocky Flocky or Way Bigger definietly give back a similar but a more tuned down vibe.

        The two singles leading up to the album's release were tracks What You Need and Drugs N Hella Melodies featuring Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis.
        
        On May 4, 2021 What You Need charted at #82 for a week on the Billboard Hot 100. However it is not the lead single of the album. In fact it's actually really hard to pick a lead song out of all the 16 tracks. Therefore it's safe to say that this thing is filled with bangers.
